# Linear function

the general linear function looks like this:

![y=m*x+c](../../pictures/linear_2.png)

## Linear1

For this method we need two points. P(x1|y1) Q(x2|y2)

At first we will get the pitch. We can do this with two given points on the function.

![y=m*x+c](../../pictures/linear_3.png)

We can move the function by adding this:

![y=m*x+c](../../pictures/linear_1.png)

Now we can calculate ```c```:

![y=m*x+c](../../pictures/linear_4.png)
